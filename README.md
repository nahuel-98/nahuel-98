I am a backend developer specialized in Node.js, currently in Argentina 🇦🇷.

I help technology companies achieve exceptional performance in their web applications. With my experience in Node.js and other related technologies, I am able to develop web applications that are highly scalable and capable of handling large volumes of user traffic.

Regarding my academic background, I graduated as a senior programming technician, thanks to which I learned to design and develop software solutions through agile methodologies. During my training, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge in practice and develop key skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity.
